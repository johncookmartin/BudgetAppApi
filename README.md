## Introduction
For years, my wife and I used an Excel spreadsheet to track our expenses. Over time, it became long, unwieldy, and difficult to maintain as we added new formulas and tracking rules.
I decided to build a custom application to make budgeting simpler, more flexible, and easier to maintain.  

This project aims to present financial data clearly while making it easy to calculate totals, trends, and other insights.
It also gives us the freedom to grow the tool in ways a static spreadsheet no longer allowed.

## Features
- Authentication Layer using EF Core (currently using Google Sign-In)
- RESTful .NET API
- SQL Server relational database
